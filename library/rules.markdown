Library Rules and Office Hours
------------------------------

While we try to showcase the best of anime in our weekly screenings, there's a lot more out there than we can possibly show. Therefore, we also maintain a large collection of anime and manga in our circulating library. Library cardholders gain the additional privilege of checking out items from our library for home viewing; for more information, consult the section below.

We hold weekly office hours in our library in W20-445 (fourth floor of the Student Center). All are invited to come in during these times to browse our extensive collections, and library cardholders may use these hours to borrow materials. In addition, non-members are also free to come in and read our manga and watch our anime during this time.

Office Hours
------------

These are the times when someone will definitely be in the library. Officers often hold unscheduled office hours, so if you're in the Student Center, feel free to stop by!

Library Cardholders
-------------------

Individuals may apply for a library card on an academic term-by-term basis. The card allows one to check out up to 30 items at any given time (up to 6 DVDs, 6 manga/books, 6 audio CDs, 6 fansub discs, 6 VHS tapes); upon return, they may check out additional items.

Unlike regular memberships, a library card requires a semesterly fee of $5 ($7 for non-students). Additionally, cardholders are required to submit a $10 deposit that will be returned by request upon the card's expiration. Freshmen and new students to MIT are allowed one term free.

To apply for a library card, complete [the following form](anime_membershipform.pdf) and submit it with payment to officers at any showing or office hour.

Trial Memberships
-----------------

MIT students and staff may also apply for a trial membership. Trial members do not receive a card, but should instead bring their MIT ID to identify themselves. Trial members may check out up to 5 items at any given time (up to 1 DVD/Blu-Ray, 1 manga/book, 1 audio CD, 1 fansub disc, 1 VHS tape); upon return, they may check out additional items.

Unlike full memberships, trial memberships are free.

To become a trial member, e-mail <anime-library@mit.edu> and we will add you as a member.

### How to request items for checkout

Requests are not necessary if you come to office hours to check items out. However, if you would like to pick up items at a showing or event, or would like to have an item delivered, please e-mail <anime-library@mit.edu> with a list of your requests.

-   **To request a delivery or pick-up,** please fill out the delivery [form](delivery.php). All items delivered are still subject to the standard rules - in particular, items must be returned on time to the library, even if there are no delivery hours available.
-   **For pick ups at showings,** items will be handed out during intermissions; you must be present to claim them. Please put in your request by e-mail or form ahead of time (no later than noon on the day of the showing), or in writing at the previous week's showing.
-   Use the item ID numbers in your request (titles are optional), and please do not request items that don't appear on the lists.
-   Request items in priority order, and we will best to give you the highest-ranking titles that do not conflict with other people's requests. You may wish to request more items than you expect to get in order to maximize the number of requests we can fulfill for you. If you wish to check out fewer items than the checkout limit (5 items per item type for up to 30 items), please specify this in your e-mail or form entry.
