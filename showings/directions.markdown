The easiest way to get to MIT is by the subway. Take the Red Line to
Kendall Square.

If you were traveling _outbound_, say from BU, you\'ll come up on the
Coop side of Main Street. Cross Main Street and continue in the same
direction.

If you were traveling _inbound_, say from Harvard, there are two places
you can come up.

If you can look across Main Street and see the other T entrance, just
keep walking away from Main Street. If you can\'t, you need to walk
along Main Street (keeping it on your right) until you see the two T
entrances.

Now you should be walking away from Main Street. Cross the crosswalk
that should be right in front of you, then keep walking straight until
you get to Amherst Street. Turn right and follow it until it runs into
Ames Street. Cross Ames Street and keep going straight. You should now
be at MIT.
