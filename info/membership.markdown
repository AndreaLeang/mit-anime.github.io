Club Membership
---------------

**Overview**

While all of our showings are free to MIT students and staff, there are
benefits to becoming an official club member. Becoming a member is free
and commitment-free and simply allows us to keep better number of the
individuals that we serve, for accounting purposes.

Members receive a member identification card, which expires four years
from date of issue. This card allows members to enter club raffles for
free prizes and to gain discounts at local anime-related stores.
Additionally, only MIT students with a current club membership may vote
in elections.

Membership alone does not entitle one to check out items from the
library, however; for that information, please check out our page on
[library rules.](../library/rules.php)

**Discounts**

Club Members receive discounts at select anime stores:

-   AniMadness offers a 10% discount for everyone who is a member of an
    anime club. The store is located in Waltham and online at
    www.animadness.com.
-   Million Year Picnic, one of the nation's finest comic-book stores,
    with an extensive selection of manga and independent comics, located
    in Harvard Square, offers a 10% discount.
-   Comicopia, another excellent comic-book store with an extensive
    manga selection, located at the east end of Kenmore Square, offers a
    10% discount.

Present your membership card or information when buying products from
these stores.
