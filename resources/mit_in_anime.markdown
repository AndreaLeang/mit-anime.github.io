Appearances of MIT in Anime {#appearances-of-mit-in-anime}
---------------------------

Dating at least from the days of "God of Manga" Osamu Tezuka's interest
in the genre, science fiction has long been one of the major streams of
anime. Given the fictional science focus of many anime titles, it should
come as no surprise that MIT is occasionally mentioned in anime. Of
course, MIT usually is used to fill the role of "generic non-Japanese
source of advanced technology", but it is rare for *any* other American
college to be mentioned in anime, while MIT's appearances are frequent
and widespread.

Mostly, this prominence is probably just a matter of MIT being a
well-established, globally-recognized brand when it comes to advanced
technology and science, or educating people who are good at that sort of
thing. But MIT shows up in other places as well.

Here are some anime and manga mentions of Mother Institute:

-   MIT vice-president and dean Vannevar Bush plays a **major** role in
    *Serial Experiments Lain*, particularly in episode 9.

    As pointed out in [Thought Experiments
    Lain](http://www.cjas.org/~leng/lain.htm#knights), *Serial
    Experiments Lain*'s "Knights of the Eastern Calculus" may be
    inspired by [the Knights of the Lambda
    Calculus](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/k/KnightsoftheLambdaCalculus.html),
    membership in the outer circles of which has long been one of the
    privileges granted to survivors of
    [6.001.](http://sicp.ai.mit.edu/Spring-2004/)

    We have to admit that this is a bit of a stretch and is certainly
    utterly obscure outside the confines of 6.001. What probably
    happened is two independent sets of people were inspired by a cool
    phrase from hacker lore (given LISP's long-time popularity at MIT,
    it's reasonable to suppose that the phrase may have originated
    here).

    Really this entry exists because the web needed a place for the
    following screenshot of Lain using LISP on her portable Navi:

-   ![](../images/mitinanime_nadesico1.jpg) Uri-P, the
    lunatic chief engineer of the *Nadesico* says in episode 12 that he
    tried to get into MIT. He failed seven times, no doubt much to the
    relief of the people who would have had to compete against him in
    the [2.70](http://pergatory.mit.edu/2.007/) contest!

    He says he modelled the virtual reality representation of Omoikane,
    the *Nadesico*'s computer, on MIT's library (and it does look a bit
    like the view from the mezzanine in Hayden Library):

    ![](../images/mitinanime_nadesico2.jpg)

-   One of the five sets of Magi supercomputers attacking the Magi at
    NERV in *The end of Evangelion* is located in Massachusetts.

    We think it's fair to count this. Of course, it's clear that MIT no
    longer exists in these days after the Second Impact (at least not on
    the present banks of the Charles).

    ![](../images/mitinanime_eva.jpg)

-   In the first *Patlabor* movie E. Hoba, the author of the Labor
    virus, graduated from MIT, and one or two mentions were made of
    efforts by people at MIT to eradicate the virus.

-   The character Alexander Howell from Yuu Watase's *Ayashi no Ceres*
    is a graduate of MIT.

    ![](../images/mitinanime_ayashi.jpg)

-   The person Vision was hunting early in *Bubblegum Crisis* episode 7
    was an MIT graduate (he got an MD! presumably from the medical
    school that will be established sometime in the next thirty years).
    Mention of this shows up on a data screen when Sylvie agrees to have
    the Knight Sabers act as his body guard.

-   In the *Magical Girl Pretty Sammy* Tenchi Muyo manga story-line,
    Washu graduated from MIT at age 11.

    ![](../images/mitinanime_tenchi.jpg)

-   11 seems to be a good age to graduate from MIT. In *Paniponi Dash*,
    11-year-old teacher and robotics genius, Rebecca Miyamoto (recently
    arrived from America), says that she attended MIT (though she has a
    great deal of trouble pronouncing "Massachusetts").

    ![](../images/mitinanime_paniponi.jpg)

-   In *Hanaukyo Maid Tai*, episode 13, the character Shinshei goes to a
    leading, albeit unnamed, university:

    ![](../images/mitinanime_hanamaid1.jpg)![](../images/mitinanime_hanamaid2.jpg)

- Anyone who has seen MIT's Great Court can have no doubt what university it was:

    ![](../images/mitinanime_hanamaid3.jpg)![](../images/mitinanime_hanamaid4.jpg)

    Tech is hell.

    In episode 8 there's more conclusive evidence. A few minutes into
    the episode we see a shot of her desk, on which sits a letter
    designating her as an MIT fellow.

-   In *Amazing Nurse Nanako* episode 4 "Firecrackers'', we meet "Dr.
    Kyoji.... the youngest foreign student in MIT history'' *(younger
    even than Washu and Becky?)* "from Japan.... earned a doctorate
    degree''.

-   One of the members of Heroes (evidently a Pillows cover-band),
    on-stage in the last episode of *Beck:*

    ![](../images/mitinanime_beck.jpg)

-   *A! My Goddess*'s Keichi and his sempais go to *Nekomi* Institute of
    Technology, but they cosplay as some other institution's
    cheerleaders.

    ![](../images/mitinanime_megami.jpg)

    (Though that looks like a "neko" (cat) design behind the initials,
    so maybe it's just a misprint. But the image is too good to pass
    up.)

-   In *Boku no Sexual Harassment* Episode 2, one of the characters went
    to MIT, and the action is set in Boston. There is absolutely no way
    we will post a picture from this one.

-   ![](../images/mitinanime_genshiken.jpg)This one is
    another stretch, since she never actually says *which* college in
    Boston she attended, nor which anime club she was a member of while
    here, but we like to think that *Genshiken's* Kanako Ohno's
    Boston-area anime-club membership card looked something like this:

    And we miss her presence at our cosplay workshops.

-   ![](../images/mitinanime_kamenmaid1.png)In episode 2 of *Kamen no
    Maid Guy*, the masked male maid Kogarashi offers to help his
    "master", high-school student Naeka Fujiwara, with her math
    homework. When she disdains his abilities, his fellow maid Fubuki
    alerts Naeka that:

      
      

    ![](../images/mitinanime_kamenmaid2.png)When Naeka professes
    ignorance of this "MIT", Fubuki gives a brief explanation of MIT's
    name, location, and prestige as a parade of Nobelists passes over a
    shot of Killian Court.

    Fubuki finishes by calling it "A gathering of the elites around the
    world! You can also call it the peak of mathematics."

-   In episode 10 of *Real Drive*, which takes place in 2061, an AI
    named Eliza is causing trouble in cyberspace. And where do AIs come
    from?

    ![](../images/mitinanime_realdrive.png)

-   In *Toradora!*, student council president Kanou Sumire goes to an
    American university, intending to become an astronaut. We see her
    get a postcard from Japan:

    ![](../images/mitinanime_toradora.jpg)

    (Apparently she's living in building 5.)

-   *Gundam Seed*'s George Glenn, a prodigy aerospace engineer for the
    Atlantic Federation's Federal Aeronautics and Space Administration,
    also obtained his doctorate degree from MIT at the tender age of 17.
    He eventually reveals himself to be humankind's first Coordinator,
    or genetically-enhanced human being, which may better explain this
    achievement (which comes on top of being an Olympic silver medalist,
    an American football player, and an Air Force pilot).

-   ![](../images/mitinanime_qed.png)The manga Q.E.D, which
    has yet to be adapted into an anime (but has a live-action
    version!), features yet another MIT alumni, Sou Touma, a boy who
    graduated from the Institute at 15 and returns to Japan to attend
    high school and solve random mysteries.

-   *Shinryaku! Ika Musume* features four MIT graduates Cindy, Clark,
    Harris, and Martin who dedicate their lives to studying
    extraterrestrial beings-- and believe that the title character squid
    girl is one of them. As befitting of MIT students, they're geniuses
    who have created such innovations as a cure for cancer, and a
    machine that translates any language, but unfortunately their
    talents are wasted on their obsession with aliens... which leads to
    useless inventions and bumbling schemes.

-   ![](../images/mitinanime_liargame.jpg)In the manga
    *Liar Game*, the protagonist Akiyama mentions a unique circuit,
    invented by an MIT professor (with a very difficult to romanize
    name! The closest we've gotten is "Krzysztof Ussirisky"), which does
    not interfere with medical devices. If you're a circuit expert or
    course 6er who's wondering why you haven't heard of this, fret not;
    Akiyama later admits that he totally made it up. It's the Liar Game,
    after all!
